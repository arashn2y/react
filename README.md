# React Course Repository

Welcome to the main repository for the **React Course**.

> ðŸ“‚ **Note:** The `main` branch is intentionally empty.

## ðŸ“š How This Repository Works

Each session of the course has its own dedicated branch. To access the materials, code, and exercises for a particular session, simply switch to the corresponding branch.

### ðŸ”„ Example:

To view the content for **Session One**, switch to the `session-one` branch:

```bash
git checkout session-one
```
